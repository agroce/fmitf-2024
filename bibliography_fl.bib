                  programming model for parallel and massive
                  processing of large volumes of data.  This has been
                  driven by the development of many engines and
                  frameworks such as Spark, Pig, Hive, facilitating
                  data analysis on large-scale systems. However, these
                  frameworks still remain vulnerable to communication
                  costs, data skew and tasks imbalance problems. This
                  can have a devastating effect on the performance and
                  on the scalability of these systems, more
                  particularly when treating GroupBy-Join queries of
                  large datasets.  In this paper, we present a new
                  GroupBy-Join algorithm allowing to reduce
                  communication costs considerably while avoiding data
                  skew effects.  A cost analysis of this algorithm
                  shows that our approach is insensitive to data skew
                  and ensures perfect balancing properties during all
                  stages of GroupBy-Join computation even for highly
                  skewed data. These performances have been confirmed
                  by a series of experimentations.  }

                  huge amount of data whose size is in the range of
                  hundreds of megabytes to petabytes. These data are
                  stored on geographically distributed and
                  heterogeneous resources. Researchers who need to
                  analyze and have a fast access to such data are also
                  located all over the globe. Queries executed by
                  these researchers may require the transfer of huge
                  amount of data over the wide area network in a
                  reasonable time. Due to these emerging needs, the
                  grid infrastructure which connects widely
                  geographically distributed and heterogeneous
                  computing and storage resources was born. In this
                  paper, we are interested in treating join queries on
                  the grid. We propose a new parallel algorithm
                  allowing to reduce communication and disk
                  Input/Output costs to minimum.  },

                  programming model to handle vast amounts of raw data
                  in large scale systems.  This model ensures
                  scalability, reliability and availability aspects
                  with reasonable query processing time.  However
                  these large scale systems still face some
                  challenges: data skew, task imbalance, high disk I/O
                  and redistribution costs can have disastrous effects
                  on performance.  In this paper, we introduce {\it
                  MRFA-Join} algorithm: a new frequency adaptive
                  algorithm based on MapReduce programming model and a
                  randomised key redistribution approach for join
                  processing of large-scale datasets. A cost analysis
                  of this algorithm shows that our approach is
                  insensitive to data skew and ensures perfect
                  balancing properties during all stages of join
                  computation. These performances have been confirmed

                  and simple model of parallelism yet allows to take
                  realistically into account the communication costs
                  of parallel algorithms. BSP has been used in many
                  application domains. BSPlib and its variants are
                  programming libraries for the C language that
                  support the BSP style.  Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML
                  (BSML) is a library for BSP programming with the
                  functional language OCaml. It is based on an
                  extension of the lambda-calculus by parallel
                  operations on a data structure named parallel
                  vector. BSML oﬀers a global view of programs,
                  i.e. BSML programs can be seen as sequential
                  programs working on a parallel data structure (seq
                  of par) while a BSPlib program is written in the
                  SPMD style and understood as a parallel composition
                  of communicating sequential programs (par of
                  seq). The communication styles of BSML and BSPlib
                  are also quite diﬀerent. },

                  high-level language for programming parallel
                  algorithms. Built upon the Objective Caml language,
                  it provides a safe setting for implementing Bulk
                  Synchronous Parallel (BSP) algorithms. It avoids
                  concurrency related problems: deadlocks and non-
                  determinism. BSML is based on a very small core of
                  parallel primitives that extended functional
                  sequential programming to functional BSP programming
                  with a parallel data structure and operations to
                  manipulate it. However, in practice the primitives
                  for writing the parallel non-communicating parts of
                  the program are not so easy to use. Thus we designed
                  a new syntax that makes programs easier to write and
                  read. Revised BSML is presented and its
                  expressiveness and performance are illustrated
                  through an application example. },

                  Assuming the program under verification respects an

                  original concurrent C program into a sequential one

                  User specifications are automatically reintegrated

                  devices and services, also referred to as the
                  Internet of Things (IoT), have proliferated very
                  quickly in the past years. There are now billions of
                  interconnected devices, and this number is
                  growing. It is anticipated that by 2021, about 46
                  billions of devices will be in use. Some of these
                  devices are in service in safety and security
                  critical domains, and even in domains that are not
                  necessarily critical, privacy issues may arise with
                  devices collecting and transmitting a lot of
                  personal information. Formal methods have been used
                  successfully for years in highly critical domains,
                  now they can help to bring security into the IoT
                  field. In practice it is common to rely on a
                  combination of formal methods to achieve an
                  appropriate degree of guarantee: static analyses to
                  guarantee the absence of runtime errors, deductive
                  verification of functional correctness, dynamic
                  verification for parts that cannot be proved using
                  deductive verification. This tutorial is focused on
                  Frama-C, which is a source code analysis platform
                  that aims at conducting verification of
                  industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source
                  code. Frama-C fully supports the combination of
                  formal methods approach, by providing to its users
                  with a collection of plug-ins that perform static
                  and dynamic analysis for safety and security
                  critical software. Moreover collaborative
                  verification across cooperating plugins is enabled
                  by their integration on top of a shared kernel, and
                  their compliance to a common specification language
                  ACSL. Recently Frama-C has been applied to the
                  verification of software in the context of the
                  Internet of Things.}

                  verification case study of one of its most critical
                  modules: that of linked lists.  Its API and list

                  implementations, and are particularly challenging
                  for deductive verification.  The proposed
                  verification technique relies on a parallel view of
                  a list through a companion ghost array.  This
                  approach makes it possible to perform most proofs

abstract =	 {It is commonly said the "S" in Internet of Things
                  (IoT) stands for "Security": when it is not absent,
                  it is at least unnoticeable. However, security in
                  IoT becomes an important concern since in both the
                  industry and everyday life, it is gaining wider and
                  wider adoption. Thus, IoT is now targeting more
                  critical domains, and making domains that were not
                  critical, until now, collect and transmit a lot of
                  personal data.  For years, this kind of challenges
                  have been successfully addressed in highly critical
                  domains using formal methods. Now, formal methods
                  can help to bring security in the IoT field. Frama-C
                  is a source code analysis platform used to conduct
                  verification of industrial-size programs written in
                  ISO C99. It provides a collection of plug-ins that
                  perform static and dynamic analysis for safety and
                  security critical software. These plug-ins can
                  collaborate to the verification task thanks to their
                  integration on top of a shared kernel and their
                  compliance to ACSL, a specification language for C.
                  Participants will learn how to use different Frama-C
                  analyzers and how to combine their results. During
                  the tutorial, several examples and use-cases will
                  give them a clear practical vision of possible
                  usages of the underlying static and dynamic analyses
                  in their everyday work. The presented code fragments
                  are part of Contiki, a realworld lightweight
                  operating system for the IoT. Each part consists of
                  a presentation using slides and live demonstration,
                  and a session of exercises. The attendees will be
                  provided a virtual machine image for VirtualBox
                  containing all the tools ready to use, to work on
                  the exercises. We will also provide additional
                  exercises and we will be available during the
                  conference (and after) to help the attendees who may
                  want to go beyond the tutorial material.  }

                  real-life code, making it fully automatic remains
                  difficult. The development of powerful SMT solvers
                  has improved the situation, but some proofs still
                  require interactive theorem provers in order to
                  achieve full formal verification. Auto-active
                  verification relies on additional guiding
                  annotations (assertions, ghost code, lemma
                  functions, etc.) and provides an important step
                  towards a greater automation of the proof. However,
                  the support of this methodology often remains
                  partial and depends on the verification tool.  {This
                  paper presents an experience report on a complete
                  functional verification of several C programs from

                  properties that are classically verified with
                  interactive provers.} {Based on our experience, we}
discuss the benefits of this methodology and the

                  proposals of new features to overcome them.},

                  challenges for formal verification. One of them is
                  the linked list module of Contiki, a popular
                  open-source operating system for the Internet of
                  Things. It has a rich API and uses a particular list
                  representation that make it different from the
                  classical linked list implementations. Being widely
                  used in the OS, the list module is critical for
                  reliability and security. A recent work verified the
                  list module using ghost arrays.  This article
                  reports on a new verification effort for this
                  module. Realized in the Frama-C/Wp tool, the new
                  approach relies on logic lists. A logic list
                  provides a convenient high-level view of the linked
                  list. The specifications of all functions are now
                  proved faster and almost all automatically, only a
                  small number of auxiliary lemmas and a couple of
                  assertions being proved interactively in Coq. The
                  proposed specifications are validated by proving a
                  few client functions manipulating lists. During the
                  verification, a more efficient implementation for
                  one function was found and verified. We compare the
                  new approach with the previous effort based on ghost
                  arrays, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of
                  both techniques.}

                  provides a common infrastructure and a common
                  behavioral specification language to plugins that
                  implement various static and dynamic analyses of C
                  programs. Most plugins do not support
                  concurrency. We have proposed conc2seq, a Frama-C
                  plugin based on program transformation, capable to
                  leverage the existing huge code base of plugins and
                  to handle concurrent C programs.  In this paper we
                  formalize and sketch the proof of correctness of the
                  program transformation principle behind conc2seq,
                  and present an effort towards the full mechanization
                  of both the for- malization and proofs with the
                  proof assistant Coq.}

  abstract =	 {To make parallel programming as widespread as
                  parallel architectures, more structured parallel
                  programming paradigms are necessary.  One of the
                  possible approaches are Algorithmic skeletons that
                  are abstract parallel patterns. They can be seen as
                  higher order functions implemented in
                  parallel. Algorithmic skeletons offer a simple
                  interface to the programmer without all the details
                  of parallel implementations as they abstract the
                  communications and the synchronisations of parallel
                  activities.  To write a parallel program, users have
                  to combine and compose the skeletons.  Orl\'{e}ans
                  Skeleton Library (OSL) is an efficient
                  meta-programmed C++ library of algorithmic skeletons
                  that manipulate distributed arrays.  A prototype
                  implementation of OSL exists as a library written
                  with the function parallel language Bulk Synchronous
                  Parallel ML. In this paper we are interested in
                  verifying the correctness of a subset of this
                  prototype implementation. To do so, we give a
                  functional specification (i.e. without the parallel
                  details) of a subset of OSL and we prove the
                  correctness of the BSML implementation with respect
                  to this functional specification, using the Coq
                  proof assistant. To illustrate how the user could
                  use these skeletons, we prove the correctness of two
                  applications implemented with them: a heat diffusion
                  simulation and the maximum segment sum problem.}

                  nodes in the network. Hence, point-to-point logical

                  and new avenues have to be explored.[...]In this

                  hypergraph-based networks, namely the stack-ring,
                  the stack-torus, and the hypertorus, and two very

  ABSTRACT =	 {A model of computation based on random access
                  machines operating in parallel and sharing a common
                  memory is presented. The computational power of this
                  model is related to that of traditional models. In
                  particular, deterministic parallel RAM's can accept
                  in polynomial time exactly the sets accepted by
                  polynomial tape bounded Turing machines;
                  nondeterministic RAM's can accept in polynomial time
                  exactly the sets accepted by nondeterministic
                  exponential time bounded Turing machines. Similar
                  results hold for other classes. The effect of
                  limiting the size of the common memory is also
                  considered.},

  abstract =	 { The BSML (Bulk Synchronous ML) language is a
                  data-parallel functional language for programming
                  BSP (Bulk Synchronous algorithms) algorithms in
                  so-called direct mode. In a direct mode BSP
                  algorithm, the physical structure of processes is
                  made explicit. The execution time can then be
                  estimated and dead-locks and indeterminism are
                  avoided.  The BSMLlib library, the current
                  implementation of the BSML language, permits, as an
                  extension of Objective Caml, the use of the
                  exceptions handling mechanism that comes with this
                  language.  However, the interaction of Objective
                  Caml exceptions with the BS$\lambda$-calculus (the
                  theoretical model underlying the BSML language) has
                  not yet been studied and yields some safety issues.
                  In particular, the use of collective synchronization
                  operations needs the participation of all processes
                  during the call to one of these operation, should
                  the opposite occur, processes involved in this call
                  are locked. The BSML language, without exceptions,
                  ensures that all processes participate to such a
                  call and thus that dead-locks are avoided (except
                  for process failure). When one introduces Objective
                  Caml exceptions, this safety property does not hold
                  any more.  Thus it is needed to study a new
                  semantics, suitable to exceptions handling, to
                  recover this property. The present work introduces
                  such a semantics in which the participation of all
                  processes is ensured and dead-lock issues are
                  avoided.  We will also introduce a semantics
                  allowing the pattern-matching of BSML parallel
                  vectors. This semantics has been studied in the
                  framework of a previous work on exceptions handling
                  which has not been retained here but its
                  functionalities will be nethertheless add to the
                  BSML language.}

                  the level of abstraction perceived by programmers
                  when implementing parallel applications.  In the
                  meanwhile, however, it restricts the freedom of
                  programmers to implement arbitrary parallelism
                  exploitation patterns. In this work we discuss a
                  data flow implementation methodology for skeleton
                  based structured parallel programming environments
                  that easily integrates arbitrary, user defined
                  parallelism exploitation patterns while preserving
                  most of the benefits typical of structured parallel
                  programming models.},

  abstract =	 {The multi-core trend is widening the gap between
                  programming languages and hardware. Taking
                  parallelism into account in the programs is
                  necessary to improve performance.  Unfortunately,
                  current mainstream programming languages fail to
                  provide suitable abstractions to do so.  The most
                  common pattern relies on the use of mutexes to
                  ensure mutual exclusion between concurrent accesses
                  to a shared memory.  However, this model is
                  error-prone and scales poorly by lack of modularity.
                  Recent research proposes atomic sections as an
                  alternative. The user simply delimits portions of
                  code that should be free from interference. The
                  responsibility for ensuring interference freedom is
                  left either to the compiler or to the run-time
                  system.  In order to provide enough modularity, it
                  is necessary that both atomic sections could be
                  nested and threads could be forked inside an atomic
                  section. In this paper we focus on the semantics of
                  programming languages providing these features.
                  More precisely, without being tied to a specific
                  programming language, we consider program traces
                  satisfying some basic well-formedness conditions.
                  Our main contribution is the precise definition of
                  atomicity, well-synchronisation and the proof that
                  the latter implies the strong form of the former.  A
                  formalisation of our results in the {Coq} proof

  ABSTRACT =	 { This thesis deals with machine-checking a large
                  sublanguage of sequential Java, covering nearly all
                  features, in particular the object-oriented ones. It
                  shows that embedding such a language in a theorem
                  prover and deducing practically important properties
                  is meanwhile possible and explains in detail how
                  this can be achieved.  We formalize the abstract
                  syntax, and the static semantics including the type
                  system and well-formedness conditions, as well as an
                  operational (evaluation) semantics of the language.
                  Based on these definitions, we can express soundness
                  of the type system, an important design goal claimed
                  to be reached by the designers of Java, and prove
                  that type safety holds indeed.  Moreover, we give an
                  axiomatic semantics of partial correctness for both
                  statements and (side-effecting) expressions. We
                  prove the soundness of this semantics relative to
                  the operational semantics, and even prove
                  completeness. We further give a small but
                  instructive application example.  A direct outcome
                  of this work is the confirmation that the design and
                  specification of Java (or at least the subset
                  considered) is reasonable, yet some omissions in the
                  language specification and possibilities for
                  generalizing he design can be pointed out.  The
                  second main contribution is a sound and complete
                  Hoare logic, where the soundness proof for our Hoare
                  logic gives new insights into the role of type
                  safety. To our knowledge, this logic is the first
                  one for an object-oriented language that has been
                  proved complete.  By-products of this work are a new
                  general technique for handling side-effecting
                  expressions and their results, the discovery of the
                  strongest possible rule of consequence, and a new
                  rule for flexible handling of mutual recursion.  All
                  definitions and proofs have been done fully formally
                  with the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL,
                  representing one of its major applications.  This
                  approach guarantees not only rigorous definitions,
                  but also gives maximal confidence in the results
                  obtained.  Thus this thesis demonstrates that
                  machine-checking the design of an important
                  non-trivial programming language and conducting
                  meta-theory on it entirely within a theorem proving
                  system has become a reality.  }

  abstract =	 {The integration of the generate-and-test paradigm
                  and semi-rings for the aggregation of results
                  provides a parallel programming framework for large
                  scale data-intensive applications. The so-called GTA
                  framework allows a user to define an inefficient
                  specification of his/her problem as a composition of
                  a generator of all the candidate solutions, a tester
                  of valid solutions, and an aggregator to combine the
                  solutions. Through two calculation theorems a GTA
                  specification is transformed into a
                  divide-and-conquer efficient program that can be
                  implemented in parallel. In this paper we present a
                  verified implementation of this framework in the Coq
                  proof assistant: efficient bulk synchronous parallel
                  functional programs can be extracted from naive GTA
                  specifications. We show how to apply this framework
                  on an example, including performance experiments on
                  parallel machines.},

                  have a simple cost model, nesting of parallel

  abstract =	 { The Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML) is a
                  functional language for BSP programming, a model of
                  computing which allows parallel programs to be
                  ported to a wide range of architectures. It is based
                  on an extension of the ML language by parallel
                  operations on a parallel data structure called
                  parallel vector, which is given by intention. We
                  present a new approach to certifying BSML programs
                  in the context of type theory. Given a specification
                  and a program, an incomplete proof of the
                  specification (of which algorithmic contents
                  corresponds to the given program) is built in the
                  type theory, in which gaps would correspond to the
                  proof obligation. This development demonstrates the
                  usefulness of higher-order logic in the process of
                  software certification of parallel applications. It
                  also shows that the proof of rather complex parallel
                  algorithms may be done with inductive types without
                  great difficulty by using existing certified
                  programs. This work has been implemented in the Coq
                  Proof Assistant, applied on non-trivial examples and
                  is the basis of a certified library of BSML

                  adequate cloud providers which fit their needs, as
                  the number of cloud offerings increases
                  rapidly. Many works thus focus on the design of
                  cloud brokers.  Unfortunately, most of them do not
                  consider precise security requirements of customers.
                  In this paper, we propose a methodology defined to
                  place services in a multi-provider cloud
                  environment, based on functional and non-functional
                  requirements, including security requirements.  To
                  eliminate inner conflicts within customers
                  requirements, and to match the cloud providers
                  offers with these customers requirements, we use a
                  formal analysis tool: Alloy.  The broker uses a
                  matching algorithm to place the required services in
                  the adequate cloud providers, in a way that fulfills
                  all customer requirements. We finally present a
                  prototype implementation of the proposed broker.  }

  abstract =	 { With the current generalisation of parallel
                  architectures arises the concern of applying formal
                  methods to parallelism. The complexity of parallel,
                  compared to sequential, programs makes them more
                  error-prone and difficult to verify. Bulk
                  Synchronous Parallelism (BSP) is a model of
                  computation which offers a high degree of
                  abstraction like PRAM models but yet a realistic
                  cost model based on a structured parallelism. We
                  propose a framework for refining a sequential
                  specification toward a functional BSP program, the
                  whole process being done with the help of the Coq
                  proof assistant. To do so we define BH, a new
                  homomorphic skeleton, which captures the essence of
                  BSP computation in an algorithmic level, and also
                  serves as a bridge in mapping from high level
                  specification to low level BSP parallel programs.},

                  so-called direct mode. In a direct-mode BSP

                  bulk-synchronous parallel algorithms, a model of
                  computing. Dead-locks and indeterminism are avoided
                  and the execution time can be then estimated. For
                  large scale applications where parallel processing
                  is helpful, more than one parallel machine is
                  needed.  One speaks about metacomputing. A major
                  problem in programming parallel application for such
                  platforms is their hierarchical network structures:
                  latency and bandwidth of global ones are orders of
                  magnitude worse than those of local networks. Here

                  vector, which is given by intention.  In order to
                  have an execution that follows the BSP model, and to
                  have a simple cost model, nesting of parallel
                  vectors is not allowed.  The novelty of this paper
                  is a type system which prevents such nesting.  This

                  concurrency related problems (deadlocks,

                  of OCaml can be used in BSML to respect its
                  properties of safety: this paper describes a way to
                  add exception handling to this set by extending and
                  adapting OCaml's exceptions. After a precise
                  definition of the problems that arise and an
                  informal description of the solutions, an extension
                  of BSML is proposed. Formal semantics define the
                  behaviour in all possible cases, followed by a short
                  description of the implementation.},

                  so-called direct mode. In a direct-mode BSP

  ABSTRACT =	 {Lamping discovered an optimal graph-reduction
                  implementation of the [lambda]-calculus.
                  Simultaneously, Girard invented the geometry of
                  interaction, a mathematical foundation for
                  operational semantics. In this paper, we connect and
                  explain the geometry of interaction and Lamping's
                  graphs. The geometry of interaction provides a
                  suitable semantic basis for explaining and improving
                  Lamping's system. On the other hand, graphs similar
                  to Lamping's provide a concrete representation of
                  the geometry of interaction.  Together, they offer a
                  new understanding of computation, as well as ideas
                  for efficient and correct implementations.},

                  of parallel programs in the Bird-Meertens formalism
                  (BMF), starting from divide-and-conquer algorithm
                  specifications. The contribution of the paper is
                  two-fold: (1) we classify divide-and-conquer
                  algorithms and formally derive a parameterized
                  family of parallel implementations for an important
                  subclass of divide-and-conquer, called DH
                  (distributable homomorphisms); (2) we systematically
                  adjust the mathematical specification of the Fast
                  Fourier Transform (FFT) to the DH format and thereby
                  obtain a generic SPMD program, well suited for
                  implementation under MPI. The target program
                  includes the efficient FFT solutions used in
                  practice -- the binary-exchange and the 2D- and
                  3D-transpose implementations -- as its special
                  cases.}

                  for reasoning about multithreaded Java-like programs

                  creation, thread joining and reentrant object
                  monitors. The logic is based on concurrent
                  separation logic. It is the first detailed
                  adaptation of concurrent separation logic to a
                  multithreaded Java-like language. The program logic
                  associates a unique static access permission with
                  each heap location, ensuring exclusive write
                  accesses and ruling out data races. Concurrent reads
                  are supported through fractional
                  permissions. Permissions can be transferred between
                  threads upon thread starting, thread joining,
                  initial monitor entrancies and final monitor exits.
                  This paper presents the basic principles to reason
                  about thread creation and thread joining. It
                  finishes with an outlook how this logic will evolve
                  into a full-fledged verification technique for Java
                  (and possibly other multithreaded languages).}

                  that derives programs from specification by means of
                  formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It
                  requires human insights and creativity, and needs
                  systems to help human to focus on clever parts of
                  the derivation by automating tedious ones and

                  from many existing systems, we show in this paper
                  that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap
                  way to implement a powerful system to support
                  program calculation, which has not been recognized
                  so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for
                  the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive
                  programs by program calculation and to write proofs
                  in calculational form. The use of these tactics is
                  demonstrated through program calculations in Coq

                  Brookes and Geva's generalized concrete data
                  structures are specialized with a notion of explicit
                  data layout to yield a CCC of distributed structures
                  called arrays. Arrays' symmetric replicated
                  structures, suggested by the data-parallel SPMD
                  paradigm, are found to be incompatible with sum
                  types. We then outline a functional language with
                  explicitly-distributed (monomorphic) concrete types,
                  including higher-order, sum and recursive ones. In
                  this language, programs can be as large as the
                  network and can observe communication events in
                  other programs. Such flexibility is missing from
                  current data-parallel languages and amounts to a
                  fusion with their so-called annotations, directives
                  or meta-languages. },

                  Programs with textually aligned barriers are free

                  imperative BSP program has replicated

                  architectures ran\-ge from parallelizing compilers
                  to distributed concurrent programming.  Intermediate
                  approaches propose a more structured parallelism:
                  Algorithmic skeletons are higher-order functions
                  that capture the patterns of parallel
                  algorithms. The user of the library has just to
                  compose some of the skeletons to write her parallel
                  application. When one is designing a parallel
                  program, the parallel performance is important.  It
                  is thus very interesting for the programmer to rely
                  on a simple yet realistic parallel performance model
                  such as the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)
                  model. We present OSL, the Orl\'{e}ans Skeleton
                  Library: it is a library of BSP algorithmic
                  skeletons in C++. It offers data-parallel skeletons
                  on arrays as well as communication oriented
                  skeletons.  The performances of OSL are demonstrated
                  with two applications: heat equation and FFT. },

                  parallel programming that can be combined with
                  widely used programming languages such as Java, C
                  and C++. In this paper we show that prototyping such
                  a library with a structured parallel functional
                  language, namely Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML,
                  provides a parallel implementation with which
                  experiments can be performed and gives some hints
                  about the formal semantics of the library as well.}

  abstract =	 {For over a decade, MapReduce has become a prominent
                  programming model to handle vast amounts of raw data
                  in large scale systems.  This model ensures
                  scalability, reliability and availability aspects
                  with reasonable query processing time.  However
                  these large scale systems still face some
                  challenges: data skew, task imbalance, high disk I/O
                  and redistribution costs can have disastrous effects
                  on performance.  In this paper, we introduce {\it
                  MRFA-Join} algorithm: a new frequency adaptive
                  algorithm based on MapReduce programming model and a
                  randomised key redistribution approach for join
                  processing of large-scale datasets. A cost analysis
                  of this algorithm shows that our approach is
                  insensitive to data skew and ensures perfect
                  balancing properties during all stages of join
                  computation. These performances have been confirmed
                  by a series of experimentations.}

                  (MSPML). The execution time can be estimated,
                  dead-locks and indeterminism are avoided. Programs
                  are written as usual ML programs but using a small
                  set of additional functions.  Provided functions are
                  used to access the parameters of the parallel
                  machine and to create and operate on a parallel data
                  structure. It follows the execution and cost model
                  of the Message Passing Machine model (MPM). It
                  shares with Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML its syntax
                  and high-level semantics but it has a minimally
                  synchronous distributed semantics. Experiments have

                  with the functional language Objective Caml. It is
                  based on an extension of the $\lambda$-calculus by
                  parallel operations on a parallel data structure
                  named parallel vector. The execution time can be
                  estimated, dead-locks and indeterminism are
                  avoided. Programs are written as usual functional
                  programs (in Objective Caml) but using a small set
                  of additional functions. Provided functions are used
                  to access the parameters of the parallel machine and
                  to create and operate on parallel vectors. It
                  follows the execution and cost model of the Bulk
                  Synchronous Parallel model. The paper presents the
                  lastest implementation of this library and

                  patterns or higher-order functions implemented in
                  parallel, often manipulating distributed data
                  structures. Orl\'{e}ans Skeleton Library (OSL) is a
                  library of parallel algorithmic skeletons, written
                  in C++ on top of MPI, which uses meta-programming
                  techniques for optimisation. Often such libraries
                  have no or limited support for arbitrary
                  distributions of the data structures. In this paper
                  we detail the new OSL skeletons used to manage
                  arbitrary distributions of distributed arrays. We
                  present a parallel regular sampling sort application
                  as an example of application that requires such
                  skeletons.},

                  mechanism to manage errors and events that disrupt
                  the normal flow of program instructions. In most
                  concurrent or parallel systems, exception handling
                  is done locally or sequentially, and cannot
                  guarantee the global coherence of the system after
                  an exception is caught.  Working with a {\em
                  structured parallel model} is an advantage in this
                  respect. Algorithmic skeletons, that are patterns of
                  parallel algorithms on distributed data structures,
                  offer such a structured model. However very few
                  algorithmic skeleton libraries provide a specific
                  parallel exception mechanism, and no C++-based
                  library. In this paper we propose the design of an
                  exception mechanism for the C++ Orl\'{e}ans Skeleton
                  Library that ensures the global coherence of the
                  system after exceptions are caught. We explain our
                  design choices, experiment on the performance
                  penalty of its use, and we illustrate how to
                  purposefully use this mechanism to extract the
                  results in the course of some algorithms.}

                  is an essential feature since debugging is almost
                  impossible. Building correct programs by
                  construction is not a simple task, and usually the
                  methodologies used for this purpose are rather
                  theoretical and based on a pen-and-paper style. A
                  better approach could be based on tools and theories
                  that allow a user to develop an efficient parallel
                  application by easily implementing simple programs
                  satisfying conditions, ideally automatically
                  proved. Powerlists theory and its variants represent
                  a good theoretical base for such an approach, and
                  the Coq proof assistant is a tool that could be used
                  for automatic proofs. The goal of this paper is to
                  model the powerlist theory in Coq, and to use this
                  modelling to program and reason about parallel
                  programs in Coq. This represents the first step in
                  building a framework to ease the development of
                  correct and verifiable parallel programs.},

                  software, but also to assure a high level of
                  performance and robustness.  Powerlists and their
                  variants are data structures that can be
                  successfully used in a simple, provably correct,
                  functional description of parallel programs, which
                  are divide and conquer in nature. They represent one
                  of the high-level algebraic theories which are
                  appropriate to be used as fundamentals for a model
                  of parallel computation that assures correctness
                  proving.  The paper presents how programs defined
                  based on powerlists could be transformed to real
                  code in the functional language OCaml plus calls to
                  the parallel functional programming library Bulk
                  Synchronous Parallel ML.  BSML functions follow the
                  BSP model requirements, and so its advantages are
                  introduced in OCaml parallel code. The
                  transformations are based on a framework that
                  assures: simple, correct, efficient
                  implementation. Examples are given and concrete
                  experiments for their executions are conducted. The
                  results emphasise the utility and the efficiency of
                  the framework.}

                  Abstract: Some problems require performance that
                  only massively parallel computers offer, but their
                  programming is still difficult. Works on functional
                  programming and parallelism can be divided in two
                  categories: explicit parallel extensions of
                  functional languages -- where resulting languages
                  are either non-deterministic or non functional --
                  and parallel implementations with functional
                  semantics -- where resulting languages don't express
                  parallel algorithms directly and don't allow the
                  prediction of execution times. Algorithmic skeletons
                  languages, in which only a finite set of operations
                  (the skeletons) are run in parallel, constitutes an
                  intermediate approach. Their functional semantics is
                  explicit but their parallel operational semantics is
                  implicit. The set of algorithmic skeletons has to be
                  as complete as possible but it is often dependent on
                  the domain of application.  We explore this
                  intermediate position thoroughly in order to obtain
                  universal parallel languages where source code
                  determines execution cost. This last requirement
                  forces the use of explicit processes corresponding
                  to the parallel machine's processors. A denotational
                  approach leads us to study the expressiveness of
                  functional parallel languages with explicit
                  processes. An operational approach leads us to
                  define BSP lambda-calculi (the BSP model adds a
                  notion of explicit process to data-parallelism) that
                  are confluent and universal for BSP algoritms. We
                  also analyze the conditions for parallel
                  implementation of such calculi. We have experimented
                  the associated programming style and have observed
                  that they are sufficiently expressive and allow the
                  prediction of execution times.},

                  bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) programs. It is the
                  basis for the design of a bulk synchronous parallel
                  ML language. For data-parallel languages, there are
                  two points of view: the programming model where a
                  program is seen as a sequence of operations on
                  parallel vectors, and the execution model where the
                  program is a parallel composition of programs run on
                  each processor of the parallel machine. BSP
                  algorithms are defined by data-parallel algorithms
                  with explicit (physical) processes in order to allow
                  their parallel execution time to be estimated. We
                  present here a distributed evaluation minimally
                  synchronous for BSP execution (which corresponds to
                  the execution model). This distributed evaluation is
                  correct w.r.t. the call-by-value strategy of the
                  BSlmabda_p-calculus (which corresponds to the

                  is limited by a parameter called the asynchrony
                  depth.  When processes reach this depth a global
                  synchronization occurs.  This is necessary to avoid
                  memory leak. In this paper we propose a mechanism to
                  avoid such synchronization barriers. This mechanism
                  relies on a more complex management of the
                  communication environments but with a small and
                  parametrized overhead.},

  abstract =	 { The design of parallel programs and parallel
                  programming languages is a trade-off. On one hand
                  the programs should be efficient. But the efficiency
                  should not come at the price of non portability and
                  unpredictability of performances. The portability of
                  code is needed to allow code reuse on a wide variety
                  of architectures and to allow the existence of
                  legacy code. The predictability of performances is
                  needed to guarantee that the efficiency will always
                  be achieved on any architecture.  Another very
                  important characteristic of parallel programs is the
                  complexity of their semantics. Deadlocks and
                  indeterminism often hinder the practical use of
                  parallelism by a large number of users.  To avoid
                  these undesirable properties, a trade-off has to be
                  made between the expressiveness of the language and
                  its structure which could decrease the
                  expressiveness.  Bulk Synchronous Parallelism (BSP)
                  is a model of computation which offers a high degree
                  of abstraction like PRAM models but yet a realistic
                  cost model based on a structured parallelism:
                  deadlocks are avoided and indeterminism is limited
                  to very specific cases in the BSPlib.  BSP programs
                  are portable across many parallel architectures.
                  The Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML language (BSML) is
                  based on a confluent extension of the
                  $\lambda$-calculus. Thus it is deadlock free and
                  deterministic. Being a high-level language, programs
                  are easier to write, to reuse and to compose. It is
                  even possible to certify the correctness of BSML
                  programs with the help of the Coq proof assistant.
                  However the correctness of these programs is ensured
                  with respect to the programming model of BSML. BSML,
                  as data-parallel languages, has a programming model
                  that is a formal or informal semantics of the
                  primitive operations it provides as viewed by the
                  programmer.  However the realization of the
                  primitives on parallel architecture, or execution
                  model, is quite different. Thus to guarantee the
                  correct execution of these programs in parallel, it
                  is necessary to verify the equivalence of the
                  programming model and the execution model.  This
                  talk presents the Bulk Synchronous Parallel
                  language, several formal semantics of BSML from the
                  programming model to the semantics of an abstract
                  parallel machine, and proof of correctness of BSML

                  (BSP) algorithms. It avoids concurrency related
                  problems: deadlocks and non- determinism. BSML is
                  based on a very small core of parallel primitives
                  that extended functional sequential programming to
                  functional BSP programming with a parallel data
                  structure and operations to manipulate it. However,
                  in practice the primitives for writing the parallel
                  non-communicating parts of the program are not so
                  easy to use. Thus we designed a new syntax that
                  makes programs easier to write and read. Revised

                  abstraction like PRAM models but yet a realistic
                  cost model based on a structured parallelism. We
                  propose a framework for refining a sequential
                  specification toward a functional BSP program, the
                  whole process being done with the help of the Coq
                  proof assistant. To do so we define BH, a new
                  homomorphic skeleton, which captures the essence of
                  BSP computation in an algorithmic level, and also
                  serves as a bridge in mapping from high level
                  specification to low level BSP parallel programs.}

                  language for programming parallel algorithms. Built
                  upon the Objective Caml language, it provides a safe
                  setting for implementing Bulk Synchronous Parallel
                  (BSP) algorithms. It avoids concurrency related
                  problems: deadlocks and non-determinism. BSML is
                  based on a very small core of parallel primitives
                  that extended functional sequential programming to
                  functional BSP programming with a parallel data
                  structure and operations to manipulate it. However,
                  in practice the primitives for writing the parallel
                  non-communicating parts of the program are not so
                  easy to use. Thus we designed a new syntax that
                  makes programs easier to write and read: Revised
                  BSML. In this talk, Revised BSML is presented and
                  its expressiveness and performance are illustrated
                  through an application examples. We also designed a

  abstract =	 {With parallel machines being now the norm (from
                  smart-phones to super-computers) and no longer
                  restricted to a niche, concurrent and parallel
                  programming has also to become widespread. To do so,
                  it has to move to structured paradigms, in the same
                  way sequential programming did more than forty years
                  ago. Moreover the concern of applying formal methods
                  arises, which allow specifications of parallel and
                  distributed programs to be precisely stated and the
                  conformance of an implementation to be verified
                  using mathematical techniques. However, the
                  complexity of parallel programs, compared to
                  sequential ones, makes them more error-prone,
                  difficult to verify and almost impossible to debug.
                  Parallel programs correctness by construction is
                  thus an essential feature. To build correct programs
                  by constructions is not a simple task, and usually
                  the methodologies used for this purpose are rather
                  theoretical based on a pen-and-paper style. Such
                  theoretical methodologies are usually based on
                  parallel recursive structures. They are named
                  ``parallel'' because their recursive nature makes
                  them very suitable for divide-and-conquer and thus
                  parallelism.  However when one writes an application
                  using parallel recursive structures, it is not yet
                  implemented in parallel. A realisation of parallel
                  recursive structures and their basic operations
                  should be implemented using more concrete (and
                  actually more ``flat'' than recursive) parallel
                  programming languages.  Moreover, a better approach
                  could be based on software tools and formalised
                  theories that allow a user to develop an efficient
                  parallel application by implementing easily simple
                  programs satisfying conditions, ideally
                  automatically, proved. For this purpose proof
                  assistants make the reasoning checkable by a
                  machine, may provide some automation in reasoning,
                  and actual programs may be extracted from
                  developments within these proof assistants.  This
                  talk will present an effort for providing a
                  framework based on the Coq proof assistant for the
                  systematic development of correct programs for

                  to calculate programs with the Coq proof

                  actually fulfill the requirements of the GTA

                  Coq libraries and an OCaml library for parallel
                  programming. The users write inefficient
                  (sequential) functional programs and through (partly
                  automated) program transformations based on the
                  theory of list homomorphisms, bulk synchronous
                  parallel homomorphisms or semi-ring homomorphisms,
                  an efficient sequential version is obtained. This
                  version can then be automatically parallelised
                  thanks to type class instance resolution and
                  instances relating specific sequential functions to
                  their parallel counterparts. These parallel
                  functions, also called algorithmic skeletons, are
                  written with a Coq axiomatisation of Bulk
                  Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML) primitives. To obtain
                  the final code, these Coq programs are extracted as
                  OCaml functors and are applied to modules that
                  implement the BSML library in parallel.  I will
                  first present the SyDPaCC framework from a user
                  point of view, then I will present some aspects of
                  its internals, in particular automatic
                  transformation and parallelisation using instance
                  resolution. Finally, I will discuss ongoing work

                  application is a composition of algorithmic
                  skeletons. An algorithmic skeleton captures a
                  pattern of parallel algorithm on a distributed data
                  structure, and is also often associated with a
                  sequential algorithm on a sequential data structure
                  that is the counterpart of the parallel data
                  structure. The algorithmic skeleton approach has
                  been inspired by functional programming.  It is
                  therefore very natural to embed algorithmic
                  skeletons in a functional programming language. In

                  implemented on top of BSML. It has been designed
                  without extending BSML, but only using the
                  imperative features of the underlying function
                  language OCaml. Programs implemented using this API
                  are very close to programs implemented using a
                  BSPlib library for the C language. It therefore
                  shows that BSML is universal for the BSP model.  }

  abstract =	 {With the current generalization of parallel
                  architectures and increasing requirement of parallel
                  computation arises the concern of applying formal
                  methods, which allow specifications of parallel and
                  distributed programs to be precisely stated and the
                  conformance of an implementation to be verified
                  using mathematical techniques. However, the
                  complexity of parallel programs, compared to
                  sequential ones, makes them more error-prone and
                  difficult to verify.  This calls for a strongly
                  structured form of parallelism which should not only
                  be equipped with an abstraction or model that
                  conceals much of the complexity of parallel
                  computation, but also provide a systematic way of
                  developing such parallelism from specifications for
                  practically nontrivial examples.  Transformational
                  programming is a methodology that offers some scope
                  for making the construction of efficient programs
                  more mathematical.  Program calculation is a kind of
                  program transformation based on the theory of
                  constructive algorithmics.  An efficient program is
                  derived step-by-step through a sequence of
                  transformations that preserve the meaning and hence
                  the correctness. With suitable data-structures,
                  program calculation can be used for writing parallel
                  programs.  However, once an efficient (and correct
                  with respect to the initial specification)
                  formulation of the program is obtained through
                  transformations, the program is then implemented
                  using a parallel library of algorithmic skeletons
                  most of the time written in C++ with calls to a
                  communication library such as MPI.  There is no
                  formal correspondence between the efficient program
                  obtained by transformation and the C++ skeletal
                  program. Moreover the transformation itself is
                  usually a pen-and-paper process that could contain
                  errors.  The \textsc{SyDPaCC} system is a set of
                  libraries for the Coq proof assistant that allows to
                  write naive functional programs then to transform
                  them into efficient versions that could be
                  automatically parallelised within the framework
                  before being extracted from Coq to real code in the
                  functional language OCaml plus calls to the parallel
                  functional programming library Bulk Synchronous
                  Parallel ML The tutorial is an introduction to the
                  Coq proof assistant and the \textsc{SyDPaCC} system
                  for the systematic development of correct and
                  verified parallel programs. },

                  been designed for programming bulk-synchronous
                  parallel (BSP) algorithms in so-called direct
                  mode. Its aim is to offer predictable and scalable
                  performance for BSP algorithms written as functional
                  programs. The current implementation of BSML is a
                  library and has not been validated w.r.t the
                  language's formal definition. As a library, it does
                  not allow static tools to support performance
                  management. As a first step in the construction of a
                  complete BSML language, we have defined a parallel
                  environment machine from our language's evaluation
                  semantics and begun testing the scalability and
                  predictability of its performance. This paper
                  presents the machine design and the results of our
                  experiments. },

                  paradigm could be successfully defined in a simple
                  way using powerlists.  These parallel recursive data
                  structures and their algebraic theories offer both a
                  methodology to design parallel algorithms and
                  parallel programming abstractions to ease the
                  development of parallel applications.  The paper
                  presents how programs based on powerlists can be
                  implemented in Java using the \framework{} framework
                  we developed.  The design of this framework is based
                  on powerlists theory, but in the same time follows
                  the object-oriented design principles that provide
                  flexibility and maintainability.  Examples are given
                  and performance experiments are conducted. The
                  results emphasise the utility and the efficiency of
                  the framework.},

  TITLE =	 {From {Algol} to Polymorphic Linear Lambda-Calculus},
  MONTH =	 {April},
  YEAR =	 1997,
  ABSTRACT =	 {In a linearly-typed functional language one can
                  define functions that consume their arguments in the
                  process of computing their results. This is
                  reminiscent of state transformations in imperative
                  languages. We explore this connection by translating
                  two variations on Algol 60 into a purely functional
                  language with polymorphic linear types. On one hand
                  the translations lead to a semantic analysis of
                  Algol-like programs, in terms of a model of the
                  linear language. On the other hand they demonstrate
                  that a linearly-typed functional language can be at
                  least as expressive as Algol.}

  abstract =	 {Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming
                  increasingly critical and require formal
                  verification.  Our recent work presented formal
                  verification of the linked list module of Contiki,
                  an OS for IoT. It relies on a parallel view of a
                  linked list via a companion ghost array and uses an
                  inductive predicate to link both views.  A few
                  interactively proved lemmas allow for an automatic
                  proof of other specifications, expressed in the ACSL
                  specification language and proved with the
                  Frama-C/WP tool.  In a broader verification context,
                  especially as long as the whole system is not yet
                  formally verified, it would be very useful to use
                  runtime verification, in particular, to test client
                  modules that use the list module.  It is not
                  possible with the current specifications, which
                  include an inductive predicate and axiomatically
                  defined functions.  In this early-idea paper we show
                  how to define a provably equivalent non-inductive
                  predicate and a provably equivalent non-axiomatic
                  function that belong to the executable subset \eacsl
                  of ACSL and can be transformed into executable C
                  code.  Finally, we propose an extension of Frama-C
                  to handle both axiomatic specifications for
                  deductive verification and executable specifications
                  for runtime verification.}

                  for frequent itemset mining, but to our knowledge no
                  implementation has been proven correct using
                  computer aided verification. Hu et al. derived on
                  paper an efficient algorithm for this problem,
                  starting from an inefficient functional program and
                  by using program calculation derived an efficient
                  version. Based on their work, we propose a formally
                  verified functional implementation for frequent
                  itemset mining developed with the Coq proof
                  assistant. All the proposed programs are evaluated

  ABSTRACT =	 { This paper presents a type-based information flow
                  analysis for a call-by-value lambda-calculus
                  equipped with references, exceptions and
                  let-polymorphism, which we refer to as Core ML. The
                  type system is constraint-based and has decidable
                  type inference. Its non-interference proof is
                  reasonably light-weight, thanks to the use of a
                  number of orthogonal techniques. First, a syntactic
                  segregation between values and expressions allows a
                  lighter formulation of the type system. Second,
                  non-interference is reduced to subject reduction for
                  a non-standard language extension. Lastly, a
                  semi-syntactic approach to type soundness allows
                  dealing with constraint-based polymorphism
                  separately.},

  abstract =	 { Program calculation, being a programming technique
                  that derives programs from specification by means of
                  formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It
                  requires human insights and creativity, and needs
                  systems to help human to focus on clever parts of
                  the derivation by automating tedious ones and
                  verifying correctness of transformations. Different
                  from many existing systems, we show in this paper
                  that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap
                  way to implement a powerful system to support
                  program calculation, which has not been recognized
                  so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for
                  the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive
                  programs by program calculation and to write proofs
                  in calculational form. The use of these tactics is
                  demonstrated through program calculations in Coq
                  based on the theory of lists.  },

                  programs consisting of the simply moded logic
                  programs into rewriting systems is defined. In these
                  rewriting systems conditions and explicit
                  substitutions may be present. We argue that our
                  translation is more natural than previously studied
                  ones and establish a result showing its
                  correctness.},

  abstract =	 { A collection of algebraic laws describing the
                  behaviour of BSP programming structures is
                  developed. Asynchronous communications are treated
                  as assignments to a message relation and, as such,
                  obey assignment laws. Supersteps are identified as
                  compositions of independent processes followed by a
                  barrier operation (global synchronization) which
                  ensures that ongoing asynchronous communications are
                  resolved; barrier is treated as a generalized form
                  of multiple assignment. The model has similarities
                  to that of He et al. [6] - for example, the
                  construction of communication bundles. However, He's
                  system is based on a trace model [9] while the
                  approach taken here is grounded on multiple
                  assignment and independent parallel composition. The
                  derivation, from its sequential representation, of a
                  parallel BSP-style version of Floyd's shortest path
                  algorithm is used to illustrate the use of the
                  proposed algebraic laws.  }

                  comprising a number of simultaneously executing
                  processes which may generate asynchronous
                  messages. A superstep terminates with a barrier
                  which enforces a global synchronisation and delivers
                  all ongoing communications. Multilevel supersteps
                  can utilise barriers in which subsets of processes,
                  interacting through shared memories, are locally
                  synchronised (partitioned synchronisation). In this
                  paper a state-based semantics, closely related to
                  the classical sequential programming model, is
                  derived for distributed BSP with partitioned

                  that derives programs from specification by means of
                  formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It
                  requires human insights and creativity, and needs
                  systems to help human to focus on clever parts of
                  the derivation by automating tedious ones and
                  verifying correctness of transformations. Different
                  from many existing systems, we show in this paper
                  that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap
                  way to implement a powerful system to support
                  program calculation, which has not been recognized
                  so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for
                  the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive
                  programs by program calculation and to write proofs
                  in calculational form. The use of these tactics is
                  demonstrated through program calculations in Coq
                  based on the theory of lists.  },

                  pattern for parallel programs.  Powerlists are data
                  structures that could be successfully used for
                  defining parallel programs based on this paradigm.
                  These parallel recursive data structures and their
                  algebraic theories offer both a methodology to
                  design parallel algorithms and parallel programming
                  abstractions to ease the development of parallel
                  applications.  The paper presents an improvement of
                  the parallel recursive programs defined based on
                  powerlists. The improvements is achieved by applying
                  transformation rules that introduce tuple functions
                  and prefix operators, for which a more efficient
                  execution model is defined. Together with the
                  execution model, a cost model is also defined in
                  order to allow a proper evaluation.  The treated
                  examples emphasize the fact that the transformation
                  leads to important improvements of the programs, by
                  reducing their theoretical time-complexities, and
                  the number of recursive calls, and also by allowing
                  splitting and combining of different data structures
                  to be packed together. Also, enhancing the function
                  that has to be computed to other useful functions
                  using a tuple, could improved the cost reduction
                  even more.}

                  architectures that retains enough information to
                  model performance scalability. In order to model BSP
                  program executions, Hains adapted the theory of
                  finite automata to the BSP paradigm by introducing
                  BSP automata.  In the initial description of the
                  theory, BSP automata had to be explicitly defined as
                  structured sets of states and transitions. The lack
                  of a clean and efficient algorithm for generating
                  them from regular expressions would have prevented
                  this theory from being used in practice.  To
                  alleviate this problem we introduce in this paper an
                  algorithm that generates a BSP automaton recognizing
                  a BSP language defined by a BSP regular
                  expression. The main practical use of BSP automata
                  developed in this paper is the parallelization of
                  finite state automata with an explicit distribution
                  and a performance model, that enable parallel
                  matching of regular expressions. Secondarily, BSP
                  regular expressions provide a convenient structure
                  for automatic code generation of imperative BSP
                  program that is also developed in this paper.},

                  still yields best performing SIMD codes, it is both
                  time consuming and error prone. Compiler technology
                  has greatly improved, including techniques that
                  simdize loops with misaligned accesses by
                  automatically rearranging misaligned memory streams
                  in registers.  Current techniques are applicable to
                  runtime alignments, but they aggressively reduce the
                  alignment overhead only when all alignments are
                  known at compile time. This paper presents two major
                  enhancements to the state of the art, improving both
                  performance and coverage.  First, we propose a novel
                  technique to simdize loops with runtime alignment
                  nearly as efficiently as those with compile-time
                  misalignment.  Runtime alignment is pervasive in
                  real applications because it is either part of the
                  algorithms, or it is an artifact of the compiler's
                  inability to extract accurate alignment information
                  from complex applications. Second, we incorporate
                  length conversion operations, e.g., conversions
                  between data of different sizes, into the alignment
                  handling framework. Length conversions are pervasive
                  in multimedia applications where mixed integer types
                  are often used. Supporting length conversion can
                  greatly improve the coverage of simdizable
                  loops. Experimental results indicate that our
                  runtime alignment technique achieves a 19% to 32%
                  speedup increase over prior art for a benchmark
                  stressing the impact of misaligned data. We also
                  demonstrate speedup factors of up to 8.11 for real
                  benchmarks over sequential execution.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Scalable busy-wait synchronization algorithms are
                  essential for achieving good parallel program
                  performance on large scale multiprocessors.  Such
                  algorithms include mutual exclusion locks,
                  reader-writer locks, and barrier
                  synchronization. Unfortunately, scalable
                  synchronization algorithms are particularly
                  sensitive to the effects of multiprogramming: their
                  performance degrades sharply when processors are
                  shared among different applications, or even among
                  processes of the same application. In this paper we
                  describe the design and evaluation of scalable
                  scheduler-conscious mutual exclusion locks,
                  reader-writer locks, and barriers, and show that by
                  sharing information across the kerner/application
                  interface we can improve the performance of
                  scheduler-oblivious implementations by more than an
                  order of magnitude.}

  ABSTRACT =	 "We show that the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)
                  model, originally designed for distributed-memory
                  systems, is also applicable for shared-memory
                  multicore systems and, furthermore, that BSP
                  libraries are useful in scientific computing on
                  these systems. A proof-of-concept MulticoreBSP
                  library has been implemented in Java, and is used to
                  show that BSP algorithms can attain proper speedups
                  on multicore architectures. This library is based on
                  the BSPlib implementation, adapted to an
                  object-oriented setting. In comparison, the number
                  of function primitives is reduced, while the overall
                  design simplicity is improved.  We detail applying
                  the BSP model and library on the sparse
                  matrix$\times$vector (SpMV) multiplication problem,
                  and show by performing numerical experiments that
                  the resulting BSP SpMV algorithm attains speedups,
                  in one case reaching a speedup of 3.5 for 4
                  threads. While not described in detail in this
                  paper, algorithms for the fast Fourier transform and
                  the dense LU decomposition are also investigated; in
                  one case attaining superlinear speedups of 5 for 4
                  threads. The predictability of BSP algorithms in the
                  case of the sparse matrix$\times$vector multiply is
                  also investigated."

  abstract =	 "Techniques of evolutionary computation generally
                  require significant computational resources to solve
                  non-trivial problems of interest. Increases in
                  computing power can be realized either by using a
                  faster computer or by parallelizing the application.
                  Techniques of evolutionary computation are
                  especially amenable to parallelization. This paper
                  describes how to build a 10-node Beowulf-style
                  parallel computer system for \$18,000 that delivers
                  about a half peta-flop (1015 floating-point
                  operations) per day on runs of genetic
                  programming. Each of the 10 nodes of the system
                  contains a 533 MHz Alpha processor and runs with the
                  Linux operating system. This amount of computational
                  power is sufficient to yield solutions (within a
                  couple of days per problem) to 14 published problems
                  where genetic programming has produced results that
                  are competitive with human-produced results.",

  abstract =	 {Many parallel programs are written in a
                  single-program, multiple-data (SPMD) style, in which
                  synchronization is provided using collective
                  operations that all threads execute
                  simultaneously. If these operations are not properly
                  aligned on all threads, deadlock can occur, and many
                  compiler analyses and optimizations that depend on
                  proper alignment fail. In this paper, we discuss the
                  flaws in the Titanium language's type system for
                  enforcing textual alignment of collectives. We then
                  present a system that uses runtime checks to ensure
                  alignment for two definitions of textual
                  alignment. The system instruments the code to keep
                  track of alignment in each thread and then checks
                  that alignment matches prior to performing a
                  collective operation. We have implemented the system
                  in the Titanium compiler, verifying that it catches
                  alignment errors. We tested its performance on
                  multiple application programs, demonstrating that
                  the checks have no appreciable impact on execution
                  time.},

  abstract =	 {The development of correct high performance
                  computing applications is challenged by software
                  defects that result from parallel programming. We
                  present an automatic tool that provides novel
                  correctness capabilities for application developers
                  of OpenSHMEM applications. These applications follow
                  a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model of
                  parallel programming. A strict form of SPMD
                  programming requires that certain types of
                  operations are textually aligned, i.e., they need to
                  be called from the same source code line in every
                  process. This paper proposes and demonstrates
                  run-time checks that assert such behavior for
                  OpenSHMEM collective communication calls. The
                  resulting tool helps to check program consistency in
                  an automatic and scalable fashion. We introduce the
                  types of checks that we cover and include strict
                  checks that help application developers to detect
                  deviations from expected program behavior. Further,
                  we discuss how we can utilize a parallel tool
                  infrastructure to achieve a scalable and
                  maintainable implementation for these
                  checks. Finally, we discuss an extension of our
                  checks towards further types of OpenSHMEM
                  operations.},

                  more successful than simple theoretical model and

                  conventional approaches" As the title implies, it
                  also discusses a computer architecture that is a
                  synthesis of Dataflow and Graph Reduction; this
                  alone makes it worth reading since the description
                  is the basis of Alvey's big Flagship architecture
                  project. Amos Omondi}

  abstract = {Cloud Computing has known in the past few years a fast
                  development, leading to a spike in the number of
                  companies competing on providing the best Cloud
                  services. This makes it harder for potential Cloud
                  customers to chose the adequate provider. Despite
                  its wide adoption, many are still hesitant due to
                  the security issues Cloud Computing poses. In this
                  paper, we propose a brokerage solution that
                  formalizes security properties under the form of
                  inter-VM relations, and gives the possibility of
                  setting these security requirements to its customers
                  from the first steps. This solution uses formal
                  methods and the finite model finder KodKod to verify
                  the consistency of the customer's requirements, and
                  to find a placement for his deployment model.},

  abstract =	 {<p>Houdini is a simple yet scalable technique for
                  annotation inference for modular contract checking.
                  The input to Houdini is a set of candidate
                  annotations, and the output is a consistent subset
                  of these candidates. Since this technique is most
                  useful as an annotation assistant for user-guided
                  refinement of annotations, understanding the reason
                  for the removal of annotations is crucial for a user
                  to refine the set of annotations, and classify false
                  errors easily. This is especially true for applying
                  Houdini to large legacy modules with thousands of
                  procedures and deep call chains. In this work we
                  present a method it ExplainHoudini that explains the
                  reason why a given candidate was removed, purely in
                  terms of the existing candidates. We have
                  implemented this algorithm and provide preliminary
                  experience of applying it on large modules.</p>},

                  test generator PathCrawler within the software
                  analysis platform Frama- C. When executing a dynamic
                  analysis of a C code, the integrated test generator
                  also exploits its formal specification, written in
                  an executable fragment of the acsl specification
                  language shared with other analyzers of Frama-C. The
                  test generator provides the user with accurate
                  verdicts, that other Frama-C plugins can reuse to
                  improve their own analyses. This tool is designed to
                  be the foundation stone of static and dynamic
                  analysis combinations in the Frama-C platform. Our
                  first experiments confirm the benefits of such a

 abstract="Modular deductive verification is a powerful technique capable to show that each function in a program satisfies its contract. However, function contracts do not provide a global view of which high-level (e.g. security-related) properties of a whole software module are actually established, making it very difficult to assess them. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new specification mechanism, called meta-properties. A meta-property can be seen as an enhanced global invariant specified for a set of functions, and capable to express predicates on values of variables, as well as memory related conditions (such as separation) and read or write access constraints. We also propose an automatic transformation technique translating meta-properties into usual contracts and assertions, that can be proved by traditional deductive verification tools. This technique has been implemented as a Frama-C plugin called MetAcsl and successfully applied to specify and prove safety- and security-related meta-properties in two illustrative case studies.",
