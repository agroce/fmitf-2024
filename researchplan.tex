%\subsection{From Timed Automata to \framac}
%\label{sec:ta2framac}
%\input{automatatoframac}

\textcolor{blue}{The core outcome of this project consists of
  practical methods and a framework for combining formal, static, and dynamic analysis for embedded system software written in C and C++, as well as an open-source software implementation and two real-world case studies.  This section will detail these efforts.}

\subsection{DeepState and Automated Test Generation}
\label{sec:framac2deepstate}
\input{framactodeepstate}

\subsection{Other DeepState Extensions}

\paragraph{Bounded Model Checking:}
\input{cbmcplan}

\paragraph{Explicit-State Model Checking:}
\input{spinplan}

\paragraph{Timed Automata Model Skeleton Generation:}
As noted above, one of our core assumptions is that timed automata can
model the underlying protocols in many embedded systems.  However,
writing timed automata models using \uppaal~\cite{uppaal} and
\prism~\cite{KNP2011:CAV} is at present a skill only a small number of
embedded engineers have mastered.  In order to encourage more
engineers to make use of these powerful formalisms, we propose 1) to
enable DeepState to generate \emph{traces} of the annotations related
to timing that are covered during a run and 2) to build a tool to
combine and reconcile these traces into a skeleton model for \uppaal~\cite{uppaal} or
\prism~\cite{KNP2011:CAV} (as has been done to some extent for Java~\cite{liva2017extracting}).  The structure of code (function locations
of DeepState annotations) will be used to form the structure of the
model.  Additional annotations for, e.g. probabilities, may need to be
added if not present in the code annotations, though DeepState already
has a primitive support for expressing probabilities that we plan to extend.

% \paragraph{Other Tools:}  Galois Inc. has expressed strong interest in
% an (unpaid) ongoing research collaboration to integrate their C and
% C++ relevant tools into DeepState as well, to support our general vision.


\subsection{\textcolor{blue}{Dissemination of Software}}
\label{sec:software}

The proposed methods and framework will be incorporated into a usable
open source tool.
While individual software components will be developed and evaluated
in tandem with the research efforts described above, we dedicate a
task (Task T3 in Section~\ref{sec:workplan}) for consolidating all
these components in a practical, user-friendly software tool since
adoption by real-world users is a primary scientific goal of this project.
To maximize impact, the software will be made publicly available % on GitHub
using the MIT open source software license.
We are committed to making software open source as demonstrated by previously released % research
code \cite{mleplussoftware, bernalMLEToolIntegrated2012a, openbuildnetsoftware, nghiemOpenBuildNetFrameworkDistributed2016}.


\subsection{\textcolor{blue}{Case Studies}} % for Ecological Monitoring and Control}
\label{sec:case-study}

The above briefly introduces a number of problems that we know in advance must
be dealt with in order to enable a pathway for combining formal,
static, and dynamic analysis.    At heart, however, we aim to allow
case studies to prioritize our efforts, and
are certain that other challenges will arise during these efforts.
The studies informing this research are the embedded software of %wireless sensor nodes used in the Southwest Experimental Garden Array (SEGA)~\cite{ClaEtAl11,GhoEtAl2014,BelEtAl2015} and of 
wireless sensor nodes and mobile robots in the Distributed Sensing \& Computing Over Sparse Environments (DISCOVER) Platform.

\subsubsection{Overview of the DISCOVER Platform}
\label{sec:cast-study:discover}

DISCOVER %(Distributed Sensing and Computing Over Sparse Environments)
is a cyber-infrastructure testbed for remote, rural, and sparsely populated areas.
The project is funded by NSF and led by NAU, whose team includes co-PI Nghiem (co-PI of DISCOVER).
DISCOVER consists of a fabric of highly configurable Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor nodes, autonomous and highly capable terrestrial robots and drones, and a heterogeneous wireless network.
DISCOVER sites will be located at the campuses of NAU, Navajo Technical University, and Clemsom University, as well as several remote sites.
The platform will enable focused research in many domains, including data science and machine learning, heterogeneous networked services, distributed computing and AI, control, autonomous robots, and in-network computation, among many others.
%
We will use DISCOVER for the case studies in this project.
