Just as some functions are best analyed using bounded model checking, some dynamic analysis problems are best handled by explicit-state model checking that actually executes C code, like a fuzzer, but with the capability to store states and backtrack, in order to exhaustively explore a state space, using either actual comparison of stored states or comparison of abstractions of states to guide exploration.  This approach is particularly attractive for exploring sequences of API calls; this kind of test generation was used in efforts that uncovered dozens of errors in file systems at NASA/JPL~\cite{AMAI}.

The SPIN model checker~\cite{SPIN} offers execution of C code with backtracking~\cite{ModelDriven,ModelCode}.  DeepState's {\tt OneOf} construct has a semantics that can be matched with the SPIN nondeterministic choice, which in part inspired the DeepState construct~\cite{WODA08,WODACommon}.  However, integrating SPIN as a back-end for DeepState is even more challenging than integrating CBMC.  With CBMC, the mapping from DeepState to CBMC semantics may be performed by changing included headers so that CBMC-specific constructs have differing implementations (but not semantics); SPIN however executes C code in the context of a PROMELA model, which requires rewriting a DeepState model to embed test choices inside SPIN's constructs.  This also means ``lifting'' DeepState API calls to the PROMELA level outside the C code, and bridging between nondeterminism visible to SPIN and determinism within C code; PI Groce's previous work~\cite{WODA08} can serve as a foundation.  A more fundamental problem is that while CBMC and DeepState can share a semantics for, e.g., {\tt DeepState\_Int64()}, a PROMELA model with a branching factor of, e.g., $2^{64}$ will not work.  Solutions range from using results from fuzzing to choose a limited range, to translating ``flat'' bit-value selection into a sequence of choices with a larger range but bias towards certain values, to using SPIN to control a seed and deterministically choosing random values~\cite{WODA08}, a hybrid approach.
